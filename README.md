## Github for Unity
This project was setup using the github for unity plugin [Github for Unity](https://unity.github.com/). This depends on having [git](https://git-scm.com/) and [git-lfs](https://git-lfs.github.com/) installed.
LFS - Large File Storage allows us to push large assets to the repository and they should be automatically moved to the git file server to spare us space in the repository.
